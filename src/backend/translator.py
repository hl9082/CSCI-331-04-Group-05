Purpose:
  This module defines the ASLTranslator class, which is responsible for
  translating American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into English text. It
  uses the device's camera to capture video and a machine learning model to
  interpret the signs.
Importance:
  This is a key feature of the project and one of the two primary input
  methods. It allows the user to understand signed language by reading it as
  subtitles, directly bridging a major communication gap.
